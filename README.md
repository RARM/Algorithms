# Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation (in C++) of some common data structures and algorithms.

The "Algorithms" folder contains the first implementations I did for a class (it only has two algorithms and some information about their time complexity). To open the most recent work, use Visual Studio 2019. Click on "Open > Project/Solution" and select the solution in the `Algorithms.sln` file.
