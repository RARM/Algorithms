# Personal Algorithms Collection
I've documented some algorithms, their function (what they do), and their asymptotic upper bound (Θ-notation) in the table below.

I've wrote the implementation in C++ as well. However, the implementation is just for demonstration purposes. Some libraries may offer these with compatibility for more types (or even )

| Algorithm      | Function       | Θ-notation     |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Selection Sort | Sorting arrays | Θ(n^2)         |
