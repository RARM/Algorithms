# Personal Algorithms Collection
I've documented some algorithms, their function (what they do), and their asymptotic upper bound (Θ-notation) in the table below.

I've wrote the implementation in C++ as well. However, the implementation is just for demonstration purposes. Some libraries may offer these with better compatibility. Find the C++ implementation in [`algorithms.cpp`](algorithms.cpp) and its header file [`algorithms.hpp`](algorithms.hpp).

| Algorithm      | Function                | Θ-notation     |
| :------------- | :---------------------- | :------------- |
| Selection Sort | Sorting arrays          | Θ(n^2)         |

I will implement more in the future.
