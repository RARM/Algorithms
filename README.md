# Algorithms
This repository contains my implementation (in C++) of some common data structures and algorithms.

The "Algorithms" folder contains the first implementations I did for a class (it only has two algorithms and some information about their time complexity). To open the most recent work, use Visual Studio 2019. Click on "Open > Project/Solution" and select the solution in the `Algorithms.sln` file.

## Contents
The data structures (and algorithms) that you will find are:
- Singly-Linked Lists (Data Structure)
  - Append.
  - Prepend.
  - Insert After.
  - Remove After.
  - Search.
- Doubly-Linked Lists (Data Structure)
  - Append.
  - Prepend.
  - Insert After.
  - Remove.
  - Search.
- Linked List Traversal (Algorithms)
  - Traverse.
  - Traverse Reverse (Doubly-Linked List only).

I will add more as I work on it.

## Ask
I hope my implementations help others understand more complex material. If you have a question, feel free to ask in the [Discussions](https://github.com/RARM/Algorithms/discussions) tab. I will try my best to help.
