# Personal Algorithms Collection
I've documented some algorithms, their function (what they do), and their asymptotic upper bound (Θ-notation) in the table below.

I've wrote the implementation in C++ as well. However, the implementation is just for educational purposes. Some libraries may offer these with compatibility for other data types. Find the C++ implementation in [`algorithms.cpp`](algorithms.cpp) and its header file [`algorithms.hpp`](algorithms.hpp).

| Algorithm      | Function             | Θ-notation     |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :------------- |
| Selection Sort | Sort arrays          | Θ(n^2)         |
| Merge Sort     | Sort arrays          | Θ(n log(n))    |

I will implement more algorithms in the future.

## Demo
A demonstration on how to use these implementation is shown in the [`demo.cpp`](./demo.cpp) file.
